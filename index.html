<p style="font-family:Calibri;"> VITAP.</p>
<p style="font-family:courier;">It is the core </p>
<p style="font-family:verdana;">language of the world wide web and is used to define </p>
<p> <i> the structure and layout of web documents by using </i>  </p>
<p> <strong> various tags and attributes. </strong> </p>
<p> <em> Although a fundamental language of the web, HTML is a 
static language - content created with it does not change.</em></p>
<p> One particular book which is recommended reading is <u>The Street Lawyer </u>  by <u> John Grisham </u> . This book is about a lawyer who begins re-evaluating his priorities in life when a bad 
incident occurs within his law firm. Consequently, he becomes acquainted with the inner city streets, and realizes the harsh existence of the homeless, and vows to give them a chance in the courts. <u> The Street Lawyer </u> is a great
book. It is well written and interesting. Other books by <u> John Grisham </u>include  <u> The  Firm </u>, <u> The Pelican Brief </u> , and <u>The Client.</u>
